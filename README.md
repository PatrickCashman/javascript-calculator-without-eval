# javascript_calculaor_without_eval-

This program implements a basic calculator functionality without using the JavaScript 'eval()' function. It allows users to perform calculations using both mouse clicks and keyboard input.

The program utilizes DOM manipulation techniques, such as event listeners, to capture user input events and update the display element accordingly. It employs state management to track the current state of the calculator, including the numbers being entered and the selected operator.
